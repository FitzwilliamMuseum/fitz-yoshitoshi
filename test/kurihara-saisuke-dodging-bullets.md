Firearms had been introduced 
 into Japan when a Portuguese blew off course and landed on Kyushu 
 in 1542. They quickly revolutionised Japanese warfare, but were 
 rarely depicted in Edo period prints, because of the ban on depicting 
 current or historical events within the period of the Tokugawa regime.
