title: 'Yoshitoshi: An online exhibition'
---
This online exhibition features the collection of superb impressions of woodcut prints by Yoshitoshi acquired by the Fitzwilliam Museum in 2003 with the help of the National Art Collections Fund. This collection, together with a large number of drawings by Yoshitoshi and his school, make the Fitzwilliam Museum a major resource for this artist.

You can explore the exhibition by clicking on individual prints in the Gallery, or you can choose prints from particular Series or depicting various Themes, via the menu bar down the left side of each page.

The menu also gives you the chance to learn more about the artist (About Yoshitoshi), to appreciate how the prints were made (Techniques & Special Effects), to understand unfamiliar terms (Glossary), and to discover more about Yoshitoshi on your own (Resources & Links).

These pages were first created to accompany an exhibition that displayed most of this collection for the first time in the Fitzwilliam Museum from 8 February to 24 April 2005.
