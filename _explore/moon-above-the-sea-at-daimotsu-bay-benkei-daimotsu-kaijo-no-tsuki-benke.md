From the series [**One Hundred Aspects of the Moon (Tsuki hyakkei)**]({{site.baseurl}}/series/hundred-aspects-of-the-moon) published in 1885-92.

The story of the heroic
deeds of Yoshitsune no Minamoto and his loyal servant, the warrior-priest
Benkei, was told in the Heike Monogatari (Tale of the Heike)
and the Gikeiki (Story of Yoshitsune), and retold many
times in plays and prints. This legendary episode was the central
subject of famous Noh and Kabuki plays, including the
version of Fuwa Benkei (Benkei in the Boat) starring Danjûrô
IX premiered in 11/1885. After Yoshitsune's decisive win over the
Taira clan at the battle of Dannoura in 1185, he was outlawed by
his brother Yoritomo and forced to flee the capital with his followers.
Setting sail, they were caught in an unusually violent storm and
heard the spirit voices of the Taira warriors calling for revenge.

A host of dead warriors appeared above the waves and were only quelled
when Benkei confronted them, with his rosary in hand, reciting prayers
and spells.

Kuniyoshi had depicted this episode in prints with the ghosts clearly visible; Yoshitoshi makes
them less tangible, but evokes their presence in the shapes of the
black clouds. In fine early impressions such as this example, mica
scattered on the surface shines when the print is moved in the light,
depicting the moonlight glittering on the dark waves.
