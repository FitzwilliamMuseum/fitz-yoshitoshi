This diaphonous figure
is the ghost of the most mysterious of Prince Genji's lovers in
The Tale of Genji, the 11th-century classic by Murasaki
Shikibu, who was depicted in another print in this series. In Chapter
4 of the novel, Genji is on the way to visit his old nurse when
he is attracted by the white flowers of a gourd overrunning the
garden of a dilapidated house. He asks a servant to fetch a bloom
and it is returned on a fan inscribed with a poem referring to his
'evening face', the literal meaning of yûgao, the
name of the flower (Lagenaria siceraria). He courts the mysterious
author of the poem, and takes her to a nearby villa, where she is
visited in the middle of the night by the jealous spirit of one
of Genji's lovers; she breaks into a fever and within hours she
is dead. Genji is overcome with grief and years later still longed
for a further glimpse of the woman who faded as quickly as the white
flowers in her garden.

The print shows her ghost floating through her garden on the night of a full moon: yûgao
was also known as 'moonflower', thus linking the subject to
the theme of the series. Her lips are blue, a convention for the
depiction of ghosts and corpses. Blind embossing is used to give
form to the white petals of the flowers.
