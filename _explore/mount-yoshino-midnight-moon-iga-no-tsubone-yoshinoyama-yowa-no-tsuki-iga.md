From the series One Hundred Aspects of the Moon (Tsuki hyakkei) published in 1885-92.

Against the advice of  his general Masashige, Emperor Go-Daigo (1288-1339) was encouraged
by courtier Sasaki Kiyotaka, for his own political gain, to fight
the rebelling forces of Ahikaga Takauji at the battle of Minatogawa
in 1336. As a result of losing the battle, Masashige committed suicide
and the Emperor fled to Mount Yoshino, where Kiyotaka was also forced
to commit suicide. Kiyotaka's ghost haunted and harried the exiled
courtiers, none of whom dared to face it. Finally it was confronted
by Masashige's daughter-in-law, the heroic Iga no Tsubone, who drove
it away.

Like all the prints in this series, the white title cartouche is embossed with the pattern of a textile.

The ghost has blue lips, a convention also used for corpses. Iga
no Tsubone's hair is remarkable both for its fine carving, and for
the part it plays in one of Yoshitoshi's boldest designs.
