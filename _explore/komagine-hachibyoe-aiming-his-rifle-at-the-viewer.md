From the series One Hundred Aspects of Battle chosen by Yoshitoshi (Kaidai
Hyakusenso) published in 1868-9 (65 designs were issued).

The series was based on Yoshitoshi's eye-witness  observations of the battle of Ueno on 15 May 1868, in which 2000
troops loyal to the last Tokugawa Shôgun, Yoshinobu (1837-1913),
were massacred by Imperialist forces. The shogun had surrendered
even before fighting began.

It was not allowed to publish prints of contemporary events so Yoshitoshi
dressed his series up in the guise of chiefs and warriors from the
time before the Tokugawa came to power at the end of the sixteenth
century. A modern slant is given by the depiction of contemporary
dress and weapons in Western-influenced modes of depiction, such as
the dramatic perspectival foreshortening seen here. As with many of
Yoshitoshi's prints in the violent and unsettled times of the mid
to late 1860s, the series is full of blood and gore.
