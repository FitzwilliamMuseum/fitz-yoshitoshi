The title comes from Ryutei Tanehiko's serial novel Nise murasaki inaka genji
(False Murasaki and a Rural Genji) of 1829-42, which reset the 11th-century
classic Tale of Genji in the 15th century. This scene comes
from chapter 4.

The main protagonist Ashikaga Mitsuuji and his lover Tasogare escape the watch of her mother, Shinonome,
and flee to spend the night together in an old temple. Yoshitoshi
evokes both the mood and specific descriptive elements in the novel:
the blind that Mitsuuji wraps round them to stop his sword shining
in the moonlight; their wariness as they look out for Shinonome
and her henchmen; the brilliant moon and the banks of cloud; the
desolate moor with its tangle of plume-grass and miscanthus; and
the sudden shower of rain before they glimpse the flickering temple
light in the distance. The atmosphere of the landscape is heightened
by the subtle printing, especially the effect of the clouds around
the bird and moon, which varies in each impression.

The popularity of Tanehiko's novel inspired something of a Genji craze, with associated hair-fashions
and product names, and dramatised versions of the book. Tanehiko's
novel was originally illustrated by Kunisada and it inspired many
prints by other artists including Kuniyoshi and various of Kunisada's
pupils.
