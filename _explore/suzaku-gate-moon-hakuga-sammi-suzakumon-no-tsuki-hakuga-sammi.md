From the series [**One Hundred Aspects of the Moon (Tsuki hyakkei)**]({{site.baseurl}}/series/hundred-aspects-of-the-moon) published in 1885-92.

Hakuga Sammi is the Chinese reading of the name and court rank of Minamoto no Hiromasa (918-80),
grandson of Emperor Daigo. He was a famous musician, equally adept
at playing a variety of wind and string instruments. We see him
here from the rear, wearing the robes and lacquered hat of a Heian
courtier, and playing the yokobue, a transverse flute.
He is outside the Suzaku Gate of the Daidairi enclosure in Kyoto,
which contained the imperial palace and government offices. The
identity of his companion is uncertain, but judging from his hat
and beard he is probably a foreigner.

Hiromasa's skill on the
flute was legendary and the beauty of his playing is recounted in
numerous tales. One of them tells of him being robbed of all his
possessions except a wooden flute (hichiriki). When he
picked up the remaining flute and started to play, the sound carried
through the streets to the ears of the robbers. They were so moved
by its beauty that they repented their crime and returned Hiromasa's
possessions.
