This subject comes from the Heike Monogatari (Tale of the Heike), which told the story of
the feud between the Minamoto (Genji) and Taira (Heike) clans that was
retold many times in plays and prints. Kiyomori (1118-1181) was son of
a concubine of the Emperor Shirakawa Tenno. He defeated the Minamoto clan
in 1159, and ruled as a dictatorial Chancellor of the Empire. After his
death, the power of his family vanished and the Minamoto clan took control
again.

Kiyomori was finally tortured by a fever so hot that the water boiled when he bathed. Yoshitoshi evokes
the fever with unusual and lurid colours, creating a vision of the hell
that was Kiyomori's punishment for burning a giant bronze Buddha. Kiyomori
is attended by his praying wife and son, with Enma, King of Hell, in the
background. This episode was also depicted by Kuniyoshi in a triptych
of c. 1844.
