From the series Thirty-two Aspects of Customs and Manners (Fûzoku sanjûnisô).

The geisha ('skilled performer') is seated in a pleasure boat wearing a robe of silk
gauze (ro) through which we can see her body, an effect
of virtuoso block carving. She is presumably in private, possibly
intimate company, and the sensual elements of the image also contribute
to the sense of 'Cool': her erect nipples, the breeze suggested
by her stray hair and the waves outside.

As professional entertainers, Geisha were traditionally forbidden from having sex with customers (this was reserved for licensed prostitutes), but in the Meiji period
lower class geisha were allowed an additional licence permitting
them to offer sexual favours as well. Around the date of the setting
of this print (1872/3), the government emancipated geisha from their
legal commitment to pay off their indenture, and the word geisha
was officially changed to geigi, although the meaning
remained unchanged. In contrast to prostitutes successful geisha
could achieve an unusual degree of independence. Emancipated geisha,
or those who had found a patron to pay off their indenture, could
retire and marry: many became prosperous housewives in the Meiji
period.
