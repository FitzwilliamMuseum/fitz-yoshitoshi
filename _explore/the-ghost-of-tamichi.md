From the series of 51 prints Mirror  of Famous Commanders of Japan
(Dai Nippon meishô
kagami) published in 1876-82.

This was yet another series featuring historical and legendary Japanese heroes, redefining the
nation's identity for the Meiji Era. In contrast to prints of similar
subjects from the previous decade, this series shows Yoshitoshi's
mature style flowering; the design is more personal and daring,
the drawing is more refined and sophisticated (with the growing
influence of Western drawing styles) and the colours more subtly
chosen to evoke mood and emotion.

Some disliked the novel treatment 
of subject matter, but the series was immensely popular, even though
it sold for 2.5 sen, half a sen more than the
usual price for commercial prints at this date.
Tamichi was a fourth-century
warrior who was killed by a poisoned arrow. He is depicted rising
from his grave to torment his enemies as a giant snake. The snake's
skin glistens with scattered mica.
