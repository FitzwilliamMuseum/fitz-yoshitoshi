From the series **[Thirty-two Aspects of Customs and Manners (Fûzoku sanjûnisô)]({{site.baseurl}}/series/thirty-two-aspects-of-customs-and-manners)**.

The particular word used in the title is a polite title for a housewife (naishitsu,
literally 'inner chamber') of the upper or middle class. Her life
revolved around the home with only occasional outings to the kabuki
theatre, festivals or temples. She wears a light cotton robe
(yukata) and fans the smoke from a plant that was burned
to fend off insects.

Her fan is decorated with symbols associated with chapters in Genji monogatari (The Tale of Genji); these became especially popular as a decorative device a few decades
later than the Kyôwa era (1801-4) assigned to this print.
The print is a masterpiece of design and carving, with the carefully
judged effect of the smoke veiling the colours, and the detailed
perspective of the diamond flower pattern (hanabishi) on
the yukata. Yoshitoshi allowed his student Toshiaki to
help choose the colours for this print and insisted that they had
to make it look like a real yukata. Another pupil, Kodô,
referred to this print as an example of what could be achieved when
the artist worked closely with his printers.
