From the series [**One Hundred Aspects of the Moon (Tsuki hyakkei)**]({{site.baseurl}}/series/hundred-aspects-of-the-moon) published in 1885-92.

A contemporary scene showing an everyday hero in Tokyo, a tinder-box town built of wood and paper.
Throughout his career, Yoshitoshi depicted firemen in his prints.
Not only were they popular, daredevil figures with something of
the heroic appeal of actors and wrestlers, but their distinctive
costumes and geometric standards (matoi) made them very
picturesque. Their quilted jackets were soaked with water to make
them more resistant to fire, and they could be reversed when the
fire was over to reveal a colourful lining. The character on the
back of this jacket reads matoi, indicating that this is
the standard bearer for the brigade fighting the fire in the foreground.

The character on the hat shows that he belongs to Number One Company.
Standards were held aloft on roof tops so that each brigade could
be identified and so that firemen could signal above the flames
and noise. A distant fireman holds another standard on the roof
opposite. There was great rivalry between the district brigades
because the particular brigade that saved each property was rewarded.
Spattered red lead that has blackened
gives texture and atmosphere to the smoke and flames.
