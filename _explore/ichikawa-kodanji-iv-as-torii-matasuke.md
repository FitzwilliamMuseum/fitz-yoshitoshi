This very early print, made when Yoshitoshi  was only 21, shows him trying to make his way in the field of actor
prints, then dominated by Utagawa Kunisada (1786-1865). It was published
on the occasion of the first performance of Kawatake Mokuami's play
Kagamiyama Gonichi no Iwafuji (On Mirror Mountain: Iwafuji
at a later date) at the Ichimura Theatre in Edo in the third month
of 1860. This was a sequel to an earlier play, which finished with
the death of the evil Lady Iwafuji. In this production, Kodanji
established the tradition of playing the roles of both the ghost
of Iwafuji and Matasuke, the faithful servant of a samurai.

The drama hinges on the  scene shown in this print. Matasuke has been persuaded to murder
Oryû, mistress of lord Taga no Tairyô. He attempts to
carry out the murder while she is on a ferryboat at Hashiba Ferry,
returning from an excursion to view cherry blossoms on the bank
of the Sumida River. Unfortunately he kills Tairyô's wife,
Ume no Kata, by mistake, and before realising his error he makes
his escape by leaping into the river and swimming for the bank.
He is shown in the print emerging on the bank through a bush, with
his sword in his mouth; at this moment he drops the scabbard, which
later turns out to be a vital piece of evidence associating Matasuke
with the crime. He is depicted in this pose in the illustrated programme
book (ehon banzuke) to this production.

Ichikawa Kodanji IV (1812-66) was  a disciple of the great Ichikawa Danjûrô VII in Osaka
and succeeded his teacher as Edo's leading actor after Danjûrô's
death in 1859. He overcame his slight stature and limited vocal
gifts by developing the art of 'special effects' (keren),
such as flying (chûnori) and quick-change
technique (hayagawari), but he also won acclaim for his
realism in playing well-intentioned men whose circumstances drove
them into crime. His two roles in Kagamiyama allowed him
to show off both sides of his art: dancing around in the air as
Iwafuji's ghost, and playing the great dramatic scene in which Matasuke
realises he has murdered the wrong person, which leads to his suicide.
Kodanji featured in numerous prints by artists of the previous generation,
such as Kunisada and Yoshitoshi's teacher, Kuniyoshi.
