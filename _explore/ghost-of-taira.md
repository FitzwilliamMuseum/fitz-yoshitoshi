![The ghost of Taira no Tomomori appears on the waters of Daimotsu Bay]({{site.baseurl}}/images/PD_581_1991.jpg){: .img-fluid }

Brush and black ink (sumi). Ôban format.

Preparatory drawing for a print in the series New Forms of the Thirty-six Ghosts (Shingata sanjûrokkaisen). This is probably a copy by Yoshitoshi or his studio of Yoshitoshi's final drawing for the key-block of the print.

Reitlinger Bequest, 1991
