{: .text-info }

From the series Tales of the Floating World on Eastern Brocade (Azuma no nishiki ukiyo kôdan) published in 1867-8.

In this series, popular stories (kôdari) of drama and violence from various sources were retold by Kanagaki Rôbun, whose text appears at the top of the print.
Wakashima Gonemon dives into a whirlpool to retieve an ancient dragon-headed
bell at the bottom of the Sumida river. According to the text on the
print, the Water (or Dragon) God was unwilling to part with the old
bell, the rope broke and the bell is still there at the bottom of
the river; hence the origin of the term Kanegafuchi (bell
deep).
