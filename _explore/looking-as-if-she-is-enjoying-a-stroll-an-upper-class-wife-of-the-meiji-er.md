From the series Thirty-two Aspects of Customs and Manners (Fûzoku sanjûnisô).

This famous image of western
fashion finishes the series and brings it bang up to date. No doubt
these are the garish garments described as being all the rage in
1886-9. The poet Onuma Chinzan commented: 'Everyone has adopted
the barbarian way of dress: only Sumo wrestlers and prostitutes
still wear the old clothes.' The modernity of the fashion seems
somewhat at odds with the traditional elements of the print. She
is shown walking among irises, probably in the Iris garden at Horikiri,
where fashionable people had often been depicted strolling in prints
of the Edo period. The clash of new and old is in itself a traditional
element of ukiyo-e (floating world pictures), and this
image is at the end of a long line of prints that use contemporary
fashion to bring old themes up to date.

This overt display of western fashion is exceptional in Yoshitoshi's
late work, reflecting his reservations about the changes happening
in Japan as it adopted western ways. He played a large part, along
with other leading cultural figues such as the actor Danjûrô
IX, in a campaign to preserve the traditions of the Edo period in
the face of change, especially the wholesale adoption of western
ways.
