This subject is from the Chinese novel Shuihu zhuan (The Water Margin), known in
Japanese as Suikoden, which tells of the legendary exploits
of a group of Chinese brigands during the Northern Song dynasty
(1101-26).

It was retold in a popular Japanese novel illustrated
by Hokusai, and was the subject of Kuniyoshi's first set of warrior
prints in 1827. Yoshitoshi had made earlier prints based on Suikoden,
and was evidently attracted by the anti-establishment theme.

Hyôshitô Rinchû (Lin Chong) had been as imprisoned by the minister of war, Gao,
but his sentence was commuted to service as a guard at a remote
army camp. Still desiring his death, Gao sent one of his officers,
Riku (Lu) to arrange Rinchû's murder, but with the stipulation
that he make it look like an accident. Riku set fire to Rinchû's
guardhouse (seen in the distance), but Rinchû was at that
time sheltering from the cold in a nearby temple. He was therefore
able to surprise his intended assassin and kill him.

The atmosphere of the landscape is heightened by the use of white pigment (gofun)
spattered onto the surface of the print, evoking falling flakes
of snow.
