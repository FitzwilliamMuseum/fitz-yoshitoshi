From the series **New Forms of the Thirty-six Ghosts** (_Shingata sanjûrokkaisen_).

_Tengu_ ('heavenly dogs') were a form of goblin supposed to be born from giant eggs. They usually had long noses and lived on mountains, often taking the form of itinerant mountain priests (_yamabushi_). They were usually helpful sources of advice. Kobayakawa Takakage (1532-97) served as a general to Toyotomi Hideyoshi who unified Japan at the end of the sixteenth century. During a campaign on the island of Kyushu in the 1580s he was camped on Mount Hiko, when suddenly through the mists appeared this _tengu_, dressed as a _yamabushi_, demanding sternly to talk to the general whose army had disturbed him. Kobayakawa entered into debate and gained great wisdom from the _tengu_.

The novelty of Yoshitoshi's design is to show us the view looking down through the parting of the mist to see Kobayakawa, seated for debate, and his astonished companions.
