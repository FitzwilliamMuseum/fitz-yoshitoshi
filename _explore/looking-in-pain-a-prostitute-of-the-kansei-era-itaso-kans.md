From the series Thirty-two Aspects of Customs and Manners (Fûzoku sanjûnisô).

The particular word used  in the title suggests that she is a lower-class prostitute (jorô).
Her hairstyle reproduces fashions of the Kansei era (1789-1801)
as they appeared in the prints of Utamaro, although the use of square
pins is anachronistic. She bites a handkerchief to stifle the pain
as she is tattooed; this gesture more usually seen in erotic prints
(shunga) where a woman stifles a cry of passion.

The tattoo is probably the name of her lover; a well-known print by Utamaro
shows a prostitute tattooing her name onto her lover's arm. The
print was undoubtedly intended to have erotic overtones, which are
reinforced by the glimpse of her red underrobe. Her teeth are blackened
with dye made from iron filings (ohaguro). Blackened teeth
were considered attractive (visible teeth were regarded as improper)
and were usually the mark of a married woman, although prostitutes
also blackened their teeth as a sign of adulthood.
