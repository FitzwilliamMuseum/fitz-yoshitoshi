From the series Beauty and Valour in the Novel Suikoden (Biy没 suikoden) published in 1866.

The Chinese novel Shuihu
zhuan (The Water Margin), known in Japanese as Suikoden,
tells of the legendary exploits of a group of Chinese brigands during
the Northern Song dynasty (1101-26). It was retold in a popular
Japanese novel illustrated by Hokusai, and was the subject of Kuniyoshi's
first set of warrior prints in 1827. Although the anti-establishment
heroes of the original were very popular, in this set Yoshitoshi
departed from the novel and made his own selection of Japanese heroes
from history and legend.

Takagi Umanosuke is shown
undergoing a trial of strength in a haunted temple. The subject
is related to a triptych by Kuniyoshi published in 1852, in which
Fuwa Banzaemon tries to frighten Takagi Umanosuke and Nagoya Sanzabur么
with an inflated ghost-figure in a ruined temple.
